# Project summary
This project is an interactive software application that pulls live data from Wikipedia. The user is first prompted for an article of their choice and then the 21 most recent updates to the article are returned; displaying the names of editors and timestamps of those changes were made. 

# Build and Run Instructions 
In order to run the application successfully, you must do so by running it through gradle in IntelliJ rather than straight through IntelliJ.
